#Algorithm Visualizer
A web-based application designed to help beginners and students understand how different sorting and pathfinding algorithms work through interactive and dynamic visualizations.

# üöÄ Live Demo
[Link to your live demo here]

# ‚ú® Features
Sorting Visualizer: Watch various sorting algorithms bring an array of bars to order.

Pathfinding Visualizer: Explore how pathfinding algorithms navigate a grid to find the shortest path between two points.

Dynamic Notes: Click the "Show Notes" button to get a simple, beginner-friendly explanation of the selected algorithm.

Customizable Input: Manually enter your own array for sorting or create a random maze for pathfinding.

Speed Control: Adjust the animation speed from "Very Slow" to "Very Fast" to observe each step at your own pace.

Dark/Light Mode: Toggle between themes for a comfortable viewing experience.

#üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
HTML5: Provides the foundational structure of the web application.

CSS3: Used for all styling, including responsive design, animations, and the dark/light theme.

JavaScript (ES6+): Powers all the interactive logic, including the algorithm implementations and real-time visualization.

# üß† Concepts Visualized
Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort: A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

Insertion Sort: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

Merge Sort: A "divide and conquer" algorithm that recursively splits the array and merges the sorted halves.

Quick Sort: A highly efficient "divide and conquer" algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition the array.

Heap Sort: Uses a binary heap data structure to efficiently sort elements.

Pathfinding Algorithms:
Breadth-First Search (BFS): Explores all immediate neighbor nodes before moving to the next level of nodes, guaranteeing the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores as far as possible down each branch before backtracking, often used for maze generation.

Dijkstra's Algorithm: Finds the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

*A Search:** An intelligent extension of Dijkstra's, using a heuristic function to guide its search and find the shortest path more efficiently.

#üìÇ Project Structure
This project is organized into three main files for clarity and modularity.

/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html       # The main HTML file with the page structure.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css        # All custom CSS for styling and animations.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js        # The core JavaScript logic, including all algorithms.

#‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/LokVinayin/algorithm-visualizer.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd algorithm-visualizer
