# ✨ Features
- **Sorting Visualizer:**  Watch various sorting algorithms bring an array of bars to order.

- **Pathfinding Visualizer:**  Explore how pathfinding algorithms navigate a grid to find the shortest path between two points.

- **Dynamic Notes:**  Click the "Show Notes" button to get a simple, beginner-friendly explanation of the selected algorithm.

- **Customizable Input:**  Manually enter your own array for sorting or create a random maze for pathfinding.

- **Speed Control:**  Adjust the animation speed from "Very Slow" to "Very Fast" to observe each step at your own pace.

- **Dark/Light Mode:**  Toggle between themes for a comfortable viewing experience.


# 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5:** Provides the foundational structure of the web application.

- **CSS3:** Used for all styling, including responsive design, animations, and the dark/light theme.

- **JavaScript (ES6+):** Powers all the interactive logic, including the algorithm implementations and real-time visualization.

# 🧠 Concepts Visualized
## Sorting Algorithms:

- **Bubble Sort:** A simple algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

- **Insertion Sort:** Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by inserting each element into its correct position.

- **Merge Sort:** A "divide and conquer" algorithm that recursively splits the array and merges the sorted halves.

- **Quick Sort:** A highly efficient "divide and conquer" algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition the array.

- **Heap Sort:** Uses a binary heap data structure to efficiently sort elements.

## Pathfinding Algorithms:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Explores all immediate neighbor nodes before moving to the next level of nodes, guaranteeing the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

- **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Explores as far as possible down each branch before backtracking, often used for maze generation.

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest paths from a starting node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

- **A* Search:** An intelligent extension of Dijkstra's, using a heuristic function to guide its search and find the shortest path more efficiently.
